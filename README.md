# Evaluating the Clinical Validity of ADHD Portrayals on TikTok  
### BSc Psychology Dissertation (First Class, 89%) — Sheffield Hallam University  
### By Archie-Lee Thomas Irving

## 📄 Overview

This repository contains my undergraduate dissertation:  
**Evaluating the Clinical Validity of ADHD Portrayals on TikTok**, a quantitative content analysis examining whether ADHD-related TikTok videos align with the diagnostic criteria outlined in the **DSM-5-TR**.

The project investigates the accuracy, symptom representation, and potential clinical implications of ADHD content on TikTok, particularly considering its growing influence on **self-diagnosis**, **public understanding**, and **digital mental health literacy**.

---

## 🔍 Research Aim

To determine whether ADHD-related TikTok videos provide **accurate**, **clinically valid**, and **holistic** portrayals of ADHD symptoms, and to identify which content features predict higher diagnostic accuracy.

---

## 🎯 Research Questions

1. Does TikTok content holistically and accurately represent ADHD?  
2. Which features (e.g., video duration, engagement, symptom types) predict greater diagnostic accuracy?

---

## 🧠 Key Findings

- **84%** of videos referenced at least one DSM-recognised ADHD symptom.  
- Only **7.14%** met the minimum threshold for clinical accuracy using a custom **DSM Accuracy Scale (DAS)**.  
- **Inattention symptoms** dominated the content:
  - 67.6% of all symptom mentions  
  - 3.34× more likely to be mentioned than hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms  
- “Difficulty sustaining attention” was the **most frequent symptom**.  
- **Longer videos** and **videos with more inattention symptoms** were significantly more likely to be accurate.  
- Overall, TikTok provides a **partial and often clinically inaccurate** representation of ADHD.

---

## 📊 Methodology

- **Design:** Quantitative content analysis  
- **Dataset:** 83 TikTok videos tagged with ADHD-related hashtags  
- **Data Collection:** Apify TikTok Scraper  
- **Coding Framework:**  
  - 9 DSM inattention symptoms  
  - 9 DSM hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms  
  - Additional diagnostic criteria: impairment, severity, persistence, pervasiveness, onset  
- **Novel Tool Developed:** DSM Accuracy Scale (DAS)  
- **Analysis Tools:** Excel, JASP, Jamovi  
- **Statistics Used:**  
  - Chi-square tests  
  - McNemar’s test  
  - Wilcoxon signed-rank test  
  - Multiple Linear Regression

## 📚 Abstract

Public interest in ADHD has grown significantly through platforms like TikTok, but visibility does not guarantee accuracy. This study analysed 83 TikTok videos to evaluate their clinical validity using DSM-5-TR criteria and a custom DSM Accuracy Scale (DAS). While 84% referenced DSM symptoms, only 7.14% provided diagnostically accurate portrayals. Inattention symptoms accounted for 67.6% of all symptom mentions, and both video duration and inattention frequency significantly predicted DAS scores. Findings suggest that although TikTok increases awareness, it often presents partial or inaccurate representations of ADHD, raising concerns about misinformation and its influence on public understanding and self-diagnosis.
